<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

create various types of basic and advanced graphs and charts also create interactive dashboards that allow even those without any Data Science experience to better understand data, and make more effective and informed decisions, applying  the many aspects and techniques of Data Visualization using Jupyter Notebooks and a Cloud-based IDE. useing several data visualization libraries in Python, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Plotly & Dash . <br>

Here will see:
* Simple Notebook with LSA, LDA with sklearn, LDA with Gensim
* Cleaninig and preprocessing the text(Lemmetazation, CountVector, ...) 
* Word cloud for each topic
* Each doc topic score
* using TSNE, TruncatedSVD to visualize in 3D space
* Using kmeans to find similar topics
* Inference the a new text

### Built With

Python on using Basic packages Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib <br> Plus:

*Seaborn 
*Folium 
*Plotly 
*Dash

### Installation

To run the source code 

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AbdallahY0usef/Data_Visualization_with_python_Project_IBM_Coursera.git
   ```
2. Install Previous packages
5. Run Notebook eack notebook have the commands to install it from pip

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Running

Code Run on Python 3.6.9 <br>
Some Notebook will save some results on the harddick for later process and tuning

### Future Work
* Will try to make simple Flask API, just like this <br>
https://github.com/Mohamed-Ahmed-Abo-El-Enen/AIMChallenge/tree/main/Code/app
* We could try more techniques like {Latent Semantic Analysis, pLSA, ...}
* Or Dive To DeepLearning, Neural Networks, including Word Embedding, Variational Auto-Encoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, and some complements of the LDA such as reranking words and document representations.
